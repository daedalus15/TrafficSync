<h1 align="center">Walkthrough Snapshots for TrafficSync</h1>

This folder contains step-by-step snapshots illustrating the working of the TrafficSync project. Below is a brief walkthrough of each snapshot to guide you through the functionality of the project.

### 1. 4-Way Junction Simulation

### Additional Details
- **Online Mode**: Simulates traffic density using real-time data. Visit the Vercel deployment link provided in the repository.
- **Offline Mode**: Loads a high-density traffic simulation by default for local testing.

For more details on setting up and running the project, refer to the main repository documentation.
